### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harsh. I'm a tech geek who loves to learn something new about anything. My hometown is in India, and I'm a guy who is passionate about music. I joined GitHub in the year 2017, and from then onwards it's been a great experience being with the community.

I'm still learning a lot from this community. I hope that I'll continue to follow this path.
